# TODO

- Dynamic graph with D3 force layout:

  - create an array of objects
  - clean up the component from svg element locations

  - call forceSimulation, passing in the array of objects
  - add one or more force functions (e.g. forceManyBody, forceCenter, forceCollide) to the system
  - set up a callback function to update the element positions after each tick

- Load XML from an external file.
